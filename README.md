HackRU - 2014

CodeToCode is an idea we came up with because we see so much learning going on through the internet. One of the problems for beginners that are learning to program is that they dont know how to use the code they just learned on a site like Codecademy. So we came up with a way for anyone willing to play the game to practice their skills implimenting the code you learn with a real time competitive head to head programming game to drive learning and to sharpen your skills against programmers of similar skill levels.

What we used for our Hack 

  -Twitter Bootstrap
  
	-Node.js
	
	-Socket.io
	
	-Express

Hopefully someone can help us make this project a popular learning tool / game to compete in.
